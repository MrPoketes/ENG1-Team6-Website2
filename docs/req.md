## Introduction

To define requirements we decided upon using IEEE’s 12207.1 [2] standards as a base and also followed their terminology. As a supplement we also used guru99’s article [1] to help us clarify the system requirements. to assist us in defining the system requirements in particular.

The requirements defined here were based on a few factors. We first analysed the assessment product brief and used the specific features as a base. Then we expanded on them, discussing as a group how to implement this, ensuring that each requirement was feasible and achievable.

We also organised two meetings with the customer so they could review our proposed requirements and understand how we were going to develop the system. This allowed us to reduce the chance of misinterpretations, clarify what the end product was and resolve any early issues we had.

We have sorted our requirements, into three separate tables:
User requirements, these are high-level abstractions, designed to be presentable to our customers and non-technical people in order to help us develop our functional requirements.

Functional requirements, a subset of system requirements we split up the user requirements into a more concrete implementation. This is the “business logic” of the game. Defining the behaviour (inputs and outputs) and how everything interacts together.
Non-functional requirements, also a part of system requirements, focusing more on the quality of the game. Not completing these requirements would result in a game that would be unsuitable for the customer.

To represent this data we have chosen to present through tables each focusing on different groups of requirements.The tables all follow a similar layout, the ID column uniquely identifies every requirement, with a person friendly identifier and a number as a short representation (1st number representing the type i.e. functional / non-functional etc. The 2nd number represents the object to which a group of requirements relates to i.e. boat. Finally, the 3rd represents the position in the sub-table to help us identify each requirement in the list.

The priority column helps us decide what will come first during the implementation, each requirement is ranked on the following scale:
“Low”, this requirement would be implemented for the final release build, but not in the earlier beta builds.
“Medium”, this requirement would be implemented on our second build (v0.2) as it isn’t a fundamental requirement which others build off, but it should be done before the deadline as it is still a core requirement, ensuring the implementation is to a good standard and any issues are ironed out.

“High”, needs to be implemented in our first stable version (v0.1). A lot of other requirements depend on this being present.

## User Requirements

For each requirement we attempted to capture the stakeholder's intention (these being the specific features that they requested), and a fit criterion that measures how well me reached that intention.

| ID | Description | Test | Assumptions | Priority |
|----|-------------|------|-------------|----------|
|UR_UNIQUE_BOATS 1.0.0|In all the different boats, they must all be unique in their own ways. Acceleration, Speed, Maneuverability and Robustness. Create boats based on these|Boats can be assigned different attributes. Measurable by comparing how much the boat movement after: player interaction when hitting obstacles. The boats look visually distinct.|There is a base boat. Boats have attributes to control their characteristics. Boats can be represented by an image|Medium (v0.2)|
|UR_DAMAGE 1.0.1|Colliding with obstacles damages the boat|When a boat collides, the stamina should be reduced|Boat, movement, and obstacles have been implemented|Medium (v0.2)|
|UR_CONTROLS 1.0.2|The boat responds to the controls inputted by the user in a comfortable way|Boat’s course will be adjusted when a user uses the specific keybinds|A base boat has been implemented, and is currently stationary|High (v0.1)|
|UR_MAP 1.1.0|The map through which players race includes obstacles|Must be long enough in length to cover an entire leg
Features obstacles which will reduce the player’s stamina|Need a make a background graphics to represent the map|High (v0.1)|
|UR_LANE 1.1.1|Stay in your lane, or you get a penalty of X seconds for the amount of time you spend out of it|Deliberately move the boat to the other lane, and check if a warning is given. Check to see if the penalty is different for when the time spent in it changes.|Map has already been implemented|Medium (v0.2)|
|UR_HUD 1.2.0|Have a clear UI that is easy to understand and see what corresponds to what|Displays the timer, leg, position, stamina, and robustness|Boats with variables to store their statistics have been implemented|Medium (v0.2)|
|UR_MENU 1.2.1|The game has a main menu screen|Displays game logo, buttons to navigate the game|Screens have been implemented|Medium (v0.2)|
|UR_CHANGE_RESOLUTION 1.2.2|The game should offer the option to play in different resolutions|The UI elements location and sizes should be based on the screen width and height|Game works in at least one resolution|Low (v1.0)|
|UR_DISPLAY_INSTRUCTIONS 1.2.3|The game should display instructions about the input it is expecting from the user|Display text that explains what the player has to do next|Game works, and the input used for the game has been determined|Low (v1.0)|
|UR_CHANGE_SETTINGS|The user should be able to change multiple settings in the settings screen|The available options should include audio, control and graphic settings|Game works with default settings|Low (v1.0)|
|UR_DIFFICULTY 1.3.1|Each leg of the race becomes harder|AI stats, obstacle amount, global speed movement are increased|Map, AI, unique boats, legs|Low (v1.0)|

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Description | Test | Alternatives | UR_ID |
|----|-------------|------|--------------|-------|
|FR_STAMINA|Each team gets tired and slower as the race progresses|Reaction speed to user controls progressively gets worse|Boat speed is reduced.|UR_UNIQUE_BOATS 1.0.0|
|FR_STATS|Define each stat and how they impact the boat and each other|Each stat that a boat has has an effect on its performance|Boats all act in the same way and races must be won through skill|UR_UNIQUE_BOATS 1.0.0|
|FR_ASPECT|Each boat has a different aspect|Check each boat texture to ensure they are significantly different from one another|Use boats of different sizes with the same texture to differentiate between them|UR_UNIQUE_BOATS 1.0.0|
|FR_OBSTACLES|Have the different obstacles appear on the course randomly. Each obstacle has their own damage property to the boat|Boat’s robustness is decreased by the specific damage of the obstacle|Instead of every obstacle having unique damage amounts. Make it randomly generated|UR_MAP 1.1.0  UR_DAMAGE 1.0.1|

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Description | Fit criteria | UR_ID |
|-----------------------------------------|
|NFR_FAST_CONTROLS 3.0.0|When inputting the direction, response from the game should be instant|In <0.5 seconds response to an input, if not lower|UR_BOAT_CONTROLS|
|NFR_FAST_TRANSITION 3.0.1|When switching between game states, response should be instant|In <0.5 seconds response to an input if not lower|UR_MENU, UR_HUD|

## Constraint Requirements

We had to adhere to two restraints our stakeholders, the customer and The University of York Communications Office. We are required to market and sell our came to the stakeholders ensuring it is playable and enjoyable by the ENG1 team.
