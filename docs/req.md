## Introduction

To define requirements we decided upon using IEEE’s 12207.1 [2] standards as a base and also followed their terminology. As a supplement, we also used guru99’s article [1] to help us clarify the system requirements. to assist us in defining the system requirements in particular.

The requirements defined here were based on a few factors. We first analysed the assessment product brief and used specific features as a base. Then we expanded on them, discussing as a group how to implement this, ensuring that each requirement was feasible and achievable.

We also organised two meetings with the customer so they could review our proposed requirements and understand how we were going to develop the system. This allowed us to reduce the chance of misinterpretations, clarify what the end product was, and resolve any early issues we had.

We have sorted our requirements, into three separate tables:

1. User requirements are high-level abstractions, designed to be presentable to our customers and non-technical people in order to help us develop our functional requirements.
2. Functional requirements, a subset of system requirements we split up the user requirements into a more concrete implementation. This is the “business logic” of the game. Defining the behaviour (inputs and outputs) and how everything interacts together.
3. Non-functional requirements, also a part of system requirements, focusing more on the quality of the game. Not completing these requirements would result in a game that would be unsuitable for the customer.

To represent this data we have chosen to present through tables each focusing on different groups of requirements. The tables all follow a similar layout, the ID column uniquely identifies every requirement, with a person-friendly identifier and a number as a short representation (1st number representing the type i.e. functional / non-functional, etc. The 2nd number represents the object to which a group of requirements relates to i.e. boat. Finally, the 3rd represents the position in the sub-table to help us identify each requirement in the list.

The priority column helps us decide what will come first during the implementation, each requirement is ranked on the following scale:

- “Low”, this requirement would be implemented for the final release build, but not in the earlier beta builds.
- “Medium”, this requirement would be implemented on our second build (v0.2) as it isn’t a fundamental requirement which others build off, but it should be done before the deadline as it is still a core requirement, ensuring the implementation is to a good standard and any issues are ironed out.
- “High”, needs to be implemented in our first stable version (v0.1). A lot of other requirements depend on this being present.

## User Requirements

For each requirement we attempted to capture the stakeholder's intention (these being the specific features that they requested), and a fit criterion that measures how well me reached that intention.
