# Week 4

Starting in the fourth week, we already had a lot of scripts that were working great by themselves, but we now had to focus on putting everything together.  
Since we were now a lot more experienced with the game engine, we were able to start designing a concrete architecture, based on inheritance and polymorphism, that we thought would fit best with what he had done already.  
The main priority was designing code that is highly reusable, focusing a lot on simplicity and readability.

Furthermore, we have also finished our requirements. So the people focussing on documentation, pivoted over to updating the risk assessment to include risks that we had discovered from starting to develop the game properly.
