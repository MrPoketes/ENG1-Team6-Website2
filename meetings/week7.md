# Week 7

We have everything ready for the 1.0 release of the game, so we focused on bug fixing, revising deliverables, adding code documentation and updating whatever is necessary so the project accurately matches the concrete architecture, including variable names and method names.

Furthermore, we have also refactored our deliverables more, working on the requirements where we removed requirements that weren't as relevant anymore, and improved the introduction.

For the documentation team, the main goal was finishing the risks as well so this required communication with the development team ensuring that we covered as many relevant risks as we could.

In addition, we also planned to improve the graphics, aiming to make it look more like what we have planned for the release version.

Other miscallanious things included:

* Sound design
* AI development
* Improved HUD
