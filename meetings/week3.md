# Week 3

After these two weeks, we had everything ready to create a rough abstract architecture of the game. This was a very important step, as now we were ready to distribute some tasks between the team members, in order to be able to create small bits of code that fulfill some of the tasks in the abstract architecture. We decided to follow the same tutorial and build some of the requirements we designed last weeks as standalone, small projects. These included:

- Moveable object script
- Map rendering script
- UI rendering script
- Collision detection script.

These small projects were meant to help us understand how we want to build the game and how things work together best.
This is also when we created the teamâ€™s website, where all the deliverables will be published.
After a week of work we were ready to move to the next step.
