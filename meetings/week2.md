# Week 2

Clearer view of the requirements and a picture of the project as a whole after meeting with customer. We then decided what engine/library we’d use (libGDX).

Our main goal this week was to learn about game development using libGDX, so this would involve watching tutorials, and trying to make simple demos. So this was dependant on just having a base knowledge of Java and willing to learn. This would allow us to develop a prototype quickly for the project.

## Meeting 2 (14/10/2020)

* Created GitHub repo's initialised it with libdgx

## Attendees

Dragos, Quentin, Rhys, Sam
