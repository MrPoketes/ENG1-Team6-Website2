We have identified risks that we believe are relevant to this project by going through a number of sources.

1. Researching general software development risks.
1. Discussing with other people who have had previous experience.
1. Discussing hypotheticals amongst ourselves and evaluating them.

We have chosen to deliver this in a tabular format. There are 6 defined columns for each risk. The first column being each risk’s unique ID. The second column is the type of risk. The third column is a brief description of the risk. The fourth column is the likelihood of that risk occurring on the following scale:

- Low - Very unlikely to happen, with a minuscule chance of occurring.
- Medium - It could happen or not, depending on the mitigation taken.
- High - Very large chance of occurring, and common.

The fifth column is the severity of the risk, so how much damage it could cause. This is on a scale of:

- Low - Not much damage, a couple of hours work at most. Not worth reporting
- Medium - A week of work, this could affect internal deadlines. Group members

would be informed to recover swiftly.

- High - A large sum of work or all of it is affected. Project deadline is affected. Group members and teaching staff informed to resolve.

The seventh and final column is the ownership of the risk. They will be held responsible for managing and mitigating that risk.

Our risk ownership is determined by who is most likely to experience that risk and who could help mitigate the risk.

Our risk assessment has been updated continuously since we have started this project. With it being reviewed every fortnight. Ensuring that the risks were still relevant even with a change in scope or if new risks have been identified.
